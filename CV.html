    <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
    <p> Having spent the past couple of years split between roles in E-commerce Trading and Affiliate Marketing, I have developed an extensive skill set in both technical and practical areas. 
        From guiding multiple brands through high pressure sales periods like Black Friday, to daily conversations with an abundance of different parties within THG and externally. 
        I thoroughly believe my experience in Campaign implementation & management, paired with a constant flow of new ideas, give me a strong confidence of the impact I could have in most teams, in the industry.
